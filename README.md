# MCLang

A compiled language built for creating .mcfunction files and datapacks fast.

With mclang, you can build complex games, datapacks, and more using a
**real** programming language. This allows developers to create complex
behaviors and actions with a simple language and have it compiled to mcfunction files.

## Features/Plans (so far)

- [x] Framework to compile to .mcfunction files
- [ ] Better errors
- [ ] Configuration to change Datapack metadata
- [x] Iterator loops
- [x] Basic if comparison
- [ ] Full "execute ..." compatibility
- [ ] Complex items
- [ ] Complete standard API/Library
